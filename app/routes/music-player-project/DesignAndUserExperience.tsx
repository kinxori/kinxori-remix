        This project is a practice project focused on developing a music media player application.
        The website simulates a music playback interface and incorporates interactive elements to
        enhance the user experience.
      </p>
      <h4 className='text-[16px] font-bold text-left '>Music Playback Interface</h4>
      <p>
