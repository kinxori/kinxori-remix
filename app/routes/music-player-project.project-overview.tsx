        <b>Project Overview</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The project is an educational endeavor focused on creating a fully functional music media
        player application using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
        This project serves as a practice exercise to develop programming skills and gain hands-on
        experience in web development.

        The primary purpose of this project is to simulate the development of a music media player
        from scratch. Through this project, I aimed to learn and apply essential concepts in
        frontend development, such as state management, user interface design, event handling, and
        integrating media elements.

        While this project does not have a commercial purpose, it offers valuable learning
        opportunities. By building this project, I gained insights into audio manipulation, UI/UX
        design principles, and how to create an interactive and responsive user interface.
        Additionally, the project allowed for experimentation with different features, such as play
        controls, volume adjustment, and playlist management.

        In conclusion, this project was developed as a practice exercise to delve into frontend web
        development and create a music media player application. The project allowed me to gain
        practical experience, experiment with interactive features, and enhance their programming
        skills in a controlled and educational environment.
