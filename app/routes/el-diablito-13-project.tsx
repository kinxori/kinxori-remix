                <p>This project boasts three noteworthy features:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                  <li>Intro</li>
                  <li>Navigation Bar</li>

                <p>
                  A prominent message will be displayed, encouraging users to "Click me." This
                  action will load the full website content and cause the Intro Page to disappear.
                </p>
                <h4 className="text-[16px] font-bold text-left ">Navigation Bar</h4>
                <p>
                  This navigation bar has 2 versions. 1 is used for smartphone and tablet devices.
                  The second version is for desktop devices such as laptops or PCs. Having a
                  dedicated navigation bar improves the responsive design and experiece of the user
                  regardles of the device they use to explore the website.

                  An intricate custom functionality has been implemented to facilitate the sending

                  Functions, the EmailSender library, and Google Auth services. These components
                  collaborate seamlessly to establish an email sender, enabling each user to
                  effortlessly communicate with the author in an efficient and user-friendly manner.
